# Fraction Operations

### Jhymani Joseph

### Description:

This project demonstrates basic operations on fractions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports comparison of fractions for equality. The program utilizes a `Fraction` class to represent fractions and perform operations. Key features include:

- **Addition and Subtraction**: Adjusts fractions to a common denominator before performing the operations.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies numerators and denominators directly.
- **Division**: Multiplies the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
- **Comparison**: Checks if two fractions are equal.
- **Reduction**: Simplifies fractions using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- **Input Handling**: Takes user input in the form of fractions and an operator.
- **GCD Calculation**: Used to simplify fractions.
-  **LCD Calculation**: Used to find the least common denominator for addition and subtraction.
- **Setters and Getters**: Added methods to modify and access the private members of the class.

### Files

|   #   | File            | Description                                        |
| :---: | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [Fraction.h](fraction.h) | Header file defining the `Fraction` class and its methods. |
|   2   | [Fraction.cpp](fraction.cpp) | Implementation file for the `Fraction` class, including operator overloading and fraction operations. |
|   3   | [main.cpp](main.cpp) | Main driver program that handles user input, performs operations, and displays results. |

### Instructions

1. **Compile the Program**: You need to compile all three files (`Fraction.cpp`, `Fraction.h`, and `main.cpp`) to build the executable.
